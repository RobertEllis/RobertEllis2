    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>No blog website up, with limited knowledge of coding and little knowledge on spreadsheets as well. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this year?</td>
    <td>To have a blog page which looks nice and with plenty of blogs up. Also I wanted to have more idea on how to code simple things and spreadsheets. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I feel I know have a limited idea of how to code and feel my blog page is looking good and I feel confident leaving year 9. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I feel over the year I learned very effectively and overall, employed lots of strategies to help me learn and not get distracted in class. I think I have used the internet effectively, and have looked up things when I feel they are going wrong or I need help, instead of asking teachers and peers. I feel this has helped me be more independent and learn on my own, instead of having to rely on those around me. I think I will take this into the next years of school and other subjects I do, as this idea of working on my own can be very effective in research tasks and if I am unsure of something I have been taught in class. Despite this, I feel I have also used the ideas of my peers and my teachers to help me when I am completely stuck on a task, and can again take this into my later years of school and even beyond. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning, which habits do I need to work on and what can I improve for next time? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel over the year, I possibly did not do the research of tasks as quickly as I should have, and spent too much time pondering over things that didn't matter and instead I should have (as soon as I found the problem) gotten to the research I needed to do. This would make it easier for me to get over problems quicker, and I think I should accept when I don’t know something quicker, but also not research to quickly so I do not think about what I’m doing and google would answer my questions instead of me. I can also take this to other subjects, as I need to be able to accept when I have found my limit but also when I need to push myself. </td>
