    <td>Having a running blog page that will be deleted. </td>

    <td>To have a new Github blog posting site. </td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I now have a very basic site which has been restarted and has no posts.</td>

    <td>I feel I learned very effectively this lesson, as I did not ask for too much help from the teacher and or from my peers, and when I encountered a problem, I looked up the answer and found it on my own. Although, when I did get in a problem, had looked it up and did not know what to do, I got help from my peer and this did help me get the answer I was looking for and did make progress in the end. This may not have helped my peer, but I felt like it helped me and making my peer teaching me it may have furthered his knowledge. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel like I wasn't very limited in the lesson but if I were to improve I would have spent less time at the start not doing much work and got into the work quicker than I did. Also, I could have organised my time more so that I could have completed this blog post in the lesson, and therefore not have to try and remember what I did and instead would have the memories fresh in my head.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will plan my time better, by getting to work earlier in the lesson and not wasting time trying to do things that may not be necessary and spending time on the stuff that is necessary, such as this blog post. Doing this, I would not have to try and catch up in later lessons or at home, and my time will be managed a lot more effectively.  </td>
